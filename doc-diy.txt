= Building yourself =

== Scripts ==
Run the following to get all the source files:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTK="http://git.notk.org/adrien/yypkg"

mkdir -p "yypkg" "yypkg_packages"

git clone "http://git.ocamlcore.org/yypkg/yypkg.git"
git clone "${NOTK}/mingw-builds.git"
git clone "${NOTK}/yy_of_slack.git"
git clone "${NOTK}/slackware64-current.git"
git clone "${NOTK}/mingw.git"
git clone "${NOTK}/slackbuilds.org.git"
------------------------------------------------------------------------

== Building the host system ==
This requires a slackware64 14.0 system currently. You also need a
mirror of the sources.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
MIRROR="${PWD}/mirror/slackware64-current" \
  ARCH=x86_64 \
  ./yy_of_slack/yy_of_slack.sh
------------------------------------------------------------------------

== Downloading source tarballs ==
You need to copy the same source files and patches as those in
slackware64 14.0 except for gnutls which has to be version 3.1.2. All
these files go in slackware64-current/ and follow the same hierarchy as
in slackware64 sources.

The mingw/ and slackbuilds.org/ directory also need sources.

This is not terribly practical and a simpler solution is being worked on
but won't be available before a few weeks.
