= Installation For Use With MSYS =

This tutorial will guide you through a typical installation of MSYS and
Win-builds. It has been contributed by Vincent Torri.
 
== MSYS Installation ==
1. Download
link:http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/Installer/mingw-get-setup.exe/download[mingw-get-setup.exe]
and run it.

2. Click on "Install".

3. Click on "Change" to chose another installation directory, go to C:/ and
make a new directory named "win_builds and validate". You are free to install
anywhere else but remember to keep the various paths consistent.

4. Click on "Continue".

5. Once the progress reaches 100%, click on "Next".

6. In the new window, select "All packages" and then "MSYS Base System".

7. On the right of the window, right-click on "msys-base" and select "Mark for
installation".

8. Now click on "Installation" in the menu bar at the top of the window and
then "Apply Changes".

9. In the new window, click on "Apply". Once everything is installed, use the
"Close" button and exit the installer.

== Win-builds Installation ==

1. Run MSYS from C:/win_builds/msys/1.0/msys.bat. You might want to create a
shortcut on the desktop (right-click on msys.bat then mouse over
"Send To" and click on "Desktop (Create Shortcut)".

2. Download link:win-builds-bundle-1.3-beta3.zip[the yypkg binaries] and
extract them into the home directory of MSYS
(C:/win_builds/msys/1.0/home/{your_account_name}).

3. In the MSYS prompt, enter the directory where you've extracted the yypkg
binaries (typically `win-builds-bundle') and run one of:
+
------------------------------------------------------------------------
# To install for both i686 and x86_64:
./msys-install.sh
# To install for only i686:
./msys-install.sh i686
# To install for only x86_64:
./msys-install.sh x86_64
------------------------------------------------------------------------

4. Check gcc is running well:
+
------------------------------------------------------------------------
gcc --version
------------------------------------------------------------------------

5. Set a default toolchain (optional):
+
------------------------------------------------------------------------
echo '. win-builds-switch.sh 32' >> ~/.profile
------------------------------------------------------------------------

== Change toolchain on-the-fly ==

The `win-builds-switch.sh' script takes care of everything; run it in your
shell like:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
# To switch to the i686 toolchain
. win-builds-switch.sh 32
# To switch to the x86_64 toolchain
. win-builds-switch.sh 32
------------------------------------------------------------------------
