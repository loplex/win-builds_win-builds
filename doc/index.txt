= Yypkg's mingw-builds =

Mingw-builds creates binary packages of libraries and tools for windows
in a clean and reproducible way, making building for windows easier. It
is supported by the yypkg package manager. Both of them will become
official tools and repositories for the mingw-w64 project.

* targets windows 32bit, 64 bit soon
* works on both windows and linux
* GTK+, EFLs, curl, libsoup, openssl, zlib, xz...
* binary packages
* build scripts available for everything

== Support and coverage ==
There are currently 63 packages. There are both cross and native
toolchains. The native one is new and less tested than the cross one.

=== Native toolchain supplements ===
This provides additions to the slackware packages, e.g. an OCaml native
compiler (which is needed to build the cross one).

The link:packages/native_toolchain/package_list.html[detailed list]
is available.

=== Cross-toolchain ===
The toolchain provides binutils 2.23.52.0.1, GCC 4.7.2 with C and C++,
mingw-w64 2.0.7.
The link:packages/cross_toolchain_32/package_list.html[detailed list]
is available.

=== Windows files ===
There are currently 54 non-toolchain packages with many more planned.
There are enough packages to build GTK+ and EFL applications, several
network components and GCC itself; webkit-gtk support is close.

The link:packages/windows_32/package_list.html[detailed list] is
available.

== Getting and running the system ==

=== Simple use with native compilation and prebuilt binaries ===
First, link:yypkg-bin-1.2-rc1.tar.xz[download the yypkg binaries].

Then, extract them anywhere you want. Open "cmd.exe", navigate to the
extract location and run the following commands. In this example, the
installation directory is C:/yypkg_32.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
set YYPREFIX=C:/yypkg_32
yypkg -init
yypkg -config -setpreds host="x86_64-slackware-linux"
yypkg -config -setpreds target="x86_64-slackware-linux"
sherpa -set-mirror http://yypkg.org/mingw-builds/rc3_32/packages/windows_32
sherpa -install *
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Finally, add C:/yypkg_32/bin to your PATH and you will be able to use
all the tools.

=== Simple use with cross-compilation and prebuilt binaries ===

The following commands will download and setup a system ready for
cross-compilation to i686-w64-mingw32.

First, download the base system:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
wget http://yypkg.org/mingw-builds/rc3_32/system.tar.xz
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Extract it somewhere (here in "rc3_32/"):
------------------------------------------------------------------------
mkdir rc3_32
sudo tar xf system.tar.xz -C rc3_32
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Get the project main scripts:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
git clone http://git.notk.org/adrien/yypkg/mingw-builds.git
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chroot into the base environment with several environment variables set
automatically:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
sudo ./mingw-builds/main.sh rc3_32
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The first time you get into the sytem, download and setup the
cross-toolchain and all the cross-compiled tools and libraries:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
/root/get-all-prebuilt-binaries-i686.sh
------------------------------------------------------------------------

// === Yypkg cheatsheet ===
// See "yypkg -help" for a quick reference and

// documentation] for a more complete documentation

==== Demo ====
In order to build the GTK+ Hello world, cd in the mingw-build directory
and run (copy-paste) the following:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
sudo ./main.sh rc3_32

cd root

cat << EOF > gtk_hello_world.c
#include <gtk/gtk.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    GtkWidget *window;
    gtk_init (&argc, &argv);
    window = gtk_window_new (GTK_WINDOW_TOPLEVEL);
    gtk_widget_show  (window);
    gtk_main ();
    return 0;
}
EOF

i686-w64-mingw32-gcc -o gtk_hello_world.exe gtk_hello_world.c $(pkg-config --cflags --libs gtk+-2.0)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

=== Advanced usage: Build it yourself ===
Building everything yourself is not difficult nor time-consuming: a full
build is very easy to setup and takes a couple hours on an old machine
and one hour on a quad-core from 2 to 3 years ago. The documentation is
available on a separate page link:diy.html[doc-diy].

=== Advanced usage: Package yourself ===
It is fairly easy to create new packages. The usual way is to port
Slackware build scripts to yypkg and mingw. Please refer to the
link:packaging.html[packager documentation].

== Comparison with other systems ==
Work on yypkg and the build scripts along with the infrastructure has
started several years ago, interrupted several times and already
rewritten once at least (no second-system effect in any case).

The need for such a system was pretty obvious and at the time, nothing
came any close. The requirements haven't changed much over the years;
some other projects have improved but it doesn't look like any of them
has obsoleted yypkg.

Feel free to send notes for the tables below: it is definitely nor
perfect nor complete.

mingw-get is not a package manager but merely a wrapper around wget and
tar xf: it can install packages but cannot uninstall or upgrade them.
